# Decryption
This game was sparked from the Pirate Software Game Jam 2024. The theme of this year's challenge was to incorperate the idea of "It's spreading". 
Arcady 3D maze the player has to navigate before it expands its reach and complexity such that youâ€™re lost forever.

## Description of the game:
Expanding labyrinth the player has to escape before the labryinth changes itself and expands to where the minotaur will find you first.
